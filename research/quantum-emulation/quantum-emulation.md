<h1>Quantum simulation</h1>

<p>
    Understanding complicated quantum-many-body dynamics is notoriously difficult leading often to
    numerically intractable situations. A way out of this dilemma is to engineer a well-controlled
    quantum system with which the quantum dynamics of interest can be implemented and thus studied
    in detail by changing the parameters of the quantum simulation, or better emulation. As a case
    study, we study charge and energy transfer models relevant to many important  processes in chemistry,
    biology, and emerging nanotechnologies. Such transfer processes often occur in noisy thermal environments
    that strongly modify the transfer dynamics and, in some cases, even improve the transport efficiency or
    robustness. A prominent example is the energy transfer from pigments in light-harvesting complexes towards
    reaction centers, where efficiency is believed to critically depend on the spectral properties of the
    environment. In these processes, the dominant sources of fluctuations and noise are often intramolecular
    vibrations and solvent dynamics. Understanding the influence of this molecular environment on transport
    dynamics requires solving complex and often fully quantized models that become intractable to theoretical
    treatments even for systems of moderate size.
</p>

<p>
    By implementing a minimal model, we observe vibrationally assisted energy transport between the electronic
    states of a donor and an acceptor ion augmented by coupling the donor ion to its vibration. We tune our
    emulator into several parameter regimes and, in particular, investigate the transfer dynamics in the
    nonperturbative regime often found in biochemical situations. In the future, we plan to study these
    transfer process while including more sites coupled to different engineered environmental conditions.
    In collaboration with Birgitta Whaley (University of California, Berkeley) and Mohan Sarovar (Sandia National Laboratories),
    we aim to bring new understanding to energy transduction and transport in materials, and help improve the design of
    new photodetectors and new photovoltaic systems.

<h1>Verifying an analog quantum simulator</h1>

<p>
Analog quantum simulation is expected to be a significant application of near-term quantum
devices. Verification of these devices without comparison to known simulation results will be an
important task as the system size grows beyond the regime that can be simulated classically. We
introduce a set of experimentally-motivated verification protocols for analog quantum simulators,
discussing their sensitivity to a variety of error sources and their scalability to larger system sizes. We
demonstrate these protocols experimentally using a two-qubit trapped-ion analog quantum simulator
and numerically using models of up to five qubits.
</p>

<p>
Taken together, these techniques allow for pragmatic evaluation of an analog quantum simulation device
in a way that builds confidence that the device is not only
operating consistently, but that it is also operating faithfully according to the desired target Hamiltonian.
Such techniques can be applied to subsets of a larger system to allow an experimentalist to characterize
and diagnose the behavior in a scalable way.

<h1>Precision measurements using trapped ions</h1>

<p>
    The best-known tests for the isotropy of space are Michelson-Morley type experiments. We perform such
    a test not with light, but with electrons. We measure the energy difference between two orientations of
    the electronic wavefunction of Calcium ions.  As the Earth rotates, the absolute spatial orientation of
    the two parts of the wave packet changes, and anisotropies in the electron dispersion will change the phase
    of the interference signal.  Using tools borrowed from quantum information we are able to verify spatial
    Lorentz symmetry to a precision at the 1e-18 level and below.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, we experimentally study how precision measurements can be improved by preparing entangled
    states immune to the dominant source of decoherence. Using calcium ions, we explicitly demonstrate the
    advantage from entanglement on a precision test of local Lorentz invariance for the electron. Reaching
    the quantum projection noise limit set by quantum mechanics, we observe for bipartite entangled states
    the expected gain of a factor of two in the precision. Under specific conditions, multipartite entangled
    states may yield substantial further improvements. Our measurements improve the previous best limit for
    local Lorentz invariance of the electron using calcium ions by factor of two to about 5e-19.
