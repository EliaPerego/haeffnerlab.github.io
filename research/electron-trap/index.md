Trapped ions are currently one of the most promising candidates for
building quantum computers. Building large-scale devices with trapped
ions is an immense technical challenge, partly due to the strict
requirements on laser performance and laser integration. It is possible
to replace some of the lasers with microwaves, which can be controlled
more easily and have superior performance with regards to stability and
linewidth. However, gate speeds are in the millisecond range, such that
complex algorithms with many gates may take too much time to run on a
trapped ion quantum computer.
To speed up gates, and to remove the need for laser technology entirely,
we want to implement a qubit based on a trapped electron. The qubit is
provided by the spin states in a magnetic field and the light mass of
the electron enables fast interactions between two electrons in the same
trapping potential. Besides the faster gates, the simple level structure
(just two levels) prevents leakage out of the qubit space.

The combination of fast gate operations and long coherence times make
electrons a very attractive system, that could rival trapped ions and
superconducting circuits in the long run.
