### The Platform

This ion trap features a unique geometry among surface ion traps -- three circular electrodes
in the center create a highly circularly symmetric potential, allowing ions to be trapped in a
ring. This symmetry offers numerous possibilities, such as ion crystals with perfectly even spacing
and no edge effects. These features can be exploited to simulate quantum systems with periodic
boundary conditions, in which one can study effects such as quantum friction and quantum phase
transitions of a one-dimensional periodic crystal. The rotational symmetry of this system also
makes it a great platform to study and control one of the most conceptually simple quantum systems:
the quantum rotor. For more information see
[PRL 118, 053001 (2017)](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.053001).

### Current Projects

#### Coherent control of a quantum rotor by light carrying orbital angular momentum

Using the ring trap we have realized a quantum rotor system, which exhibits quantized
angular momentum. It consists of just a single pair of ions that can freely rotate
about each other. Using laser light incident at a slight angle from the normal to
the rotor plane, we can impart angular momentum onto the rotor and create superpositions
of these quantized angular momentum states. See
[PRL 123, 133202 (2019)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.133202)
for more information. This technique however, which uses a plane wave of light, is limited
in how much angular momentum can be transferred. We aim to implement a more sophisticated
method in which light with a phase gradient in the angular direction can carry an arbitrary
but controllable angular momentum to impart onto the rotor, offering more control and allowing
the creation of more interesting rotor states. 

#### Demonstration of indistinguishability by direct particle exchange

The symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics requires that the state of a system of two
identical quantum particles obey exchange symmetry, in which the multiparticle wavefunction is
unchanged under an exchange of the two particles if they are bosons, and acquires only a minus
sign under this exchange if they are fermions. This symmetry erases the distinct identities that
this pair of particles would otherwise have, and has a wide range of implications that have been
observed in many different ways over many decades. We aim to demonstrate this by using our quantum
rotor to exchange a single pair of <sup>40</sup>Ca<sup>+</sup> ions by using a superposition of different angular momentum
states, thus directly interfering them with each other.

	Cartoon of the exchange procedure. The quantum rotor consists of two ions, na&iuml;vely distinguished by their
	positions and labeled 1 and 2. The rotor is placed into a superposition of two different rotational states,
	such that in one arm of the superposition, the pair of ions is rotating (here shown counterclockwise, in red)
	relative to the pair in the other arm (in blue). After a &pi; rotation, they have exchanged positions. Observing
	the superposition re-interfering at this point constitutes the ions interfering with each other, thus
	demonstrating that they are indeed indistinguishable.
